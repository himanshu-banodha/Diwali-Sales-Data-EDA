# Diwali-Sales-Data-EDA

Diwali is the biggest festival in India, during the Diwali festival season people buy new things, especially electronics, clothes, jewellery and many more things. As sales go up in this season, analyzing the sales data can be very helpful for businesses and it provides us valuable insights such as consumer behaviour, sales trends etc.
Based on the analysis we can make informed decisions like we can improve our marketing, optimising sales strategies etc.

### Problem Statement:
Identify trends in Diwali Sales Data and provide some valuable insights to the company.
More specifically we have to identify as follows:
1. Identify Potential Customers: Analyze customer demographics, including states, occupations, gender etc. This will help us in targeting specific customer segments & improving overall customer experience.
2. Identify Most Selling Products & Products Categories: Analyze the products & product categories that have the highest sales. This will help us in inventory planning, ensuring product availability and meeting customer demands. 

### Dataset Information:
The dataset contains sales data during the Diwali festival and contains 11251 rows & 15 columns.

### Conclusion:
Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
